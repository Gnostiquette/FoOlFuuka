===================
Choosing the server
===================

Servers come basically in 3 flavors:

-  Shared (not compatible)
-  VPS (suggested)
-  Dedicated server

We’ve been through all of them, and there you go some suggestions.

General suggestions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Pay your server month by month

   Server companies disappear, kick you off, become bad over time, leave
   you with a non-functioning server for weeks. You want to be able to
   leave anytime, so don’t commit yourself to year-long subscriptions.

-  Follow the Facebook and Twitter of your server company

   You might get special discounts, and often the guys who are behind
   the social network are nice and willing to help (and not always for
   show!).

-  Make sure there’s no extra fees for extra service

   You want to pay only once per month. Fees for reinstall, or for any
   support, means that the company is a complete joke. It is instead
   normal to have costs for bandwidth overages, and you should always
   keep an eye on bandwidth.

-  European servers often allow you not to pay VAT

   …if you are not European. Check their page or contact them for more
   info. In this guide we’ll point out which servers don’t make you pay
   the VAT.

Shared
~~~~~~

*Shared servers are currently not compatible with FoOlFuuka*. Our
database is far too fast (or rather, shared hosting doesn’t allow some
things we do)! There should be no reason to use a shared server in first
place. In particular, we won’t support free servers.

Cheap VPS cost as much as a shared server.

VPS (4-40$/month)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any medium-scale imageboard, a VPS will be enough. With FoOlFuuka
surely you will go very, very far without issues, especially following
this guide. We’ve added info for 512MB RAM servers in this guide.

We’ve been through a few companies, and here’s our favorite ones:

-  `Virpus.com`_ $4+

   Insanely cheap servers, but the performance suffers, and random
   downtimes happen. Might not have Debian 6 yet available. Virpus is
   still much better than any shared host we’ve been on. Support is good
   at times, but for what are you paying, you should feel sorry.

-  `FanaticalVPS`_ $10+

   Small and personal company. Great support, good servers, rare
   downtimes of few minutes. We love the guys over at Fanatical and they
   are incredibly fast at answering at support. You need to ask them to
   enable DNS ports via email, but they’re cool with it. You must not be
   afraid to keep in contact with them. Their “unlimited bandwidth” is
   pretty high, which means 500gb~ for the smallest plan. That is a damn
   lot.

-  `Linode`_ $20+

   Truly premium servers. We’ve been years with them. The issue is the
   bandwidth, just 100gb per 10$ you spend, but expect huge speed and a
   lot of freedom. The fastest support we’ve ever been through, and you
   can run basically anything, limited only by the RAM. With a 40$
   server you’re going really far, without downtimes, ever. Upload to
   server is free, download overage is 0.10$/GB.

Dedicated Servers (60$+)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a dedicated server with 8GB+ RAM you can move the biggest archive
in existence (ours!) but even with less you won’t be shy of hosting tens
of millions of posts. We believe with 16GB of RAM you could keep up with
500.000.000 posts without performance issues.

Welcome to the highway of imageboards!

-  `Kimsufi`_ 60-80$ (+VAT for Europeans)

   Ignore the Atom server. Kimsufi are OVH’s cheapest server offers, and
   you can get away with really powerful machines, at a cost: support.
   Kimsufi has slow support, possibly slower than Virpus. If your server
   disappears, get ready for hours of wait. Yet, for such a price, a
   whole i5 server with 2Tb of HD, 16GB of RAM and 10TB of bandwidth…
   with 1$ per extra TB is CRAZY.

-  `OVH`_ 80$+ (+VAT for Europeans)

   Like the above, but with more powerful servers, more choice, and with
   decent support. If you have money to waste, you should absolutely go
   with OVH instead of Kimsufi. If you are at this point, you probably
   own one of the biggest imageboards on Earth, and congratulations, of
   course.
