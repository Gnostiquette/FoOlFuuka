This file is about the minimum you need to know to go through the installation.

How to read
***********

-  If you aren’t running as ``root``, you will have to add ``sudo`` before
   most of the commands. You can access to the server as ``root`` from your
   user by running ``sudo -i``.

-  Code starting with ``$`` means it’s to be inserted into command line,
   ``$`` excluded.

-  You will see lots of text after ``#``. Those are our own comments and you
   shouldn’t paste them in the command line!

Things will go wrong. *Things will go, wrong.* If you’re experienced, you know
installing a server isn’t going to work out with just like a list of commands
suggests. Stuff will happen, and you will have to use `Google`_ to solve your
problems. Pasting your errors in `Google`_ will most often help solving your
problem.

We aren’t telling you to use FoOlFuuka or to buy a server to use it. That’s your
problem. This guide is not for people with faint heart, though it’s fairly
pedantic. Generally, you need to be tech-savvy to run a server, and you need to
be able to solve upcoming problems yourself (with `Google`_).

We also aren’t liable for any damage that our guide could cause. We’re only
giving you the opportunity to learn something new, and want to help you having
the most performant server and generally an easier life with it.

Thanks for understanding!
