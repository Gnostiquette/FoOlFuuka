FoOlFuuka
#########

...is an incredibly elaborate imageboard.

It is elaborate because it will leave the least possible work for you to do, which means the documentation will feel really brief if you are just going to install FoOlFuuka to use it.

Otherwise, FoOlFuuka includes a lot of features that needs extra documentation for programmers. We will try to provide guides about modifying themes and creating basic plugins.

Guides
******

:doc:`Editing the themes without messing up, with child themes <develop/editing_themes>` (intermediate)
	Nearly everyone wants to make customization to the themes, at least to customize their index page. Child themes will plug you straight into the themes without having to create one from scratch.
